# Exercise 7

## Problem 1

With the file `single_sphere` k_eff was calculated to: 
    `k_eff = 0.9522 Â± 0.0015`

In ![alt text] (SERPENT/criticality_speration.png "Criticality Plot") k_eff is plotted as a function of the distance between 2 identical spheres.
The critical distance of this configuration is `d = 0.5 cm`  

## Problem 2

The Sphere has to be a mass of approx. `18 kg`. 
This is much more difficult to transport and manufacture than small high grade cores.

## Problem 3

We can see a law of diminishing returns for k_eff with respect to reflector thickness.
This is intuitive, because the outer layers of the reflector get progressively less neutron flux,
because the last layer already reflected some of them back.

## Problem 4

It takes the Yongbyon Reactor approximately ` ` to produce a _significant Quantity_ of Plutonium.
This Plutonium needs to be refined, because i has still a large fraction of Pu-240. 
If the reactor is allowed to run for longer, more plutonium is produced, but the quality get progressively worse.
