# Problem 1

## a

The mass of the particle is way smaller than the momentum, 
so that E approx. p. This assumption is justified, because 
to create a jet, a particle must have a significant more energy than 
the rest mass of a hadron.

## b

See code.

## c

We found that for R = 0.5 there are 2 jets with:

`p = 31.2, y = 1.9926855205584426, phi = 2.9475`

and

`p = 30.0, y = 1.280043536501692, phi = 1.65625`
